# HappyThoughtSocialNetwork


## Description
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This was a social network API that allows users to share thoughts, react to thoughts, add or remove friends and add or remove reactions. I used the Mongoose and Express.js packages to create this API. 

## Usage
This can be easily used by typing 'node server.js' in terminal

## This API being used in Insomomnia
